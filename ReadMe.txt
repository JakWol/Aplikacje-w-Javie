Hello
This is a simple app for a coin toss
Most of the code is Auto-Generated by Android Studio
Mostly it is my lerning repo that i am currently developing.
I am quite new with this enviroment, up to some moment ago, I studied raw Java with some Swing Addition
The app is quite simple and requires a lot of work, but it is bassicaly a new journey for me.

To launch this app, please go to
app\release\ folder and instal app-release on a device (virtual or standard)
If you try to install on your phone please enable external app for instalation
